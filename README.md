# Media-Recomendation-System
The Media Content Recommendation System is a Streamlit web application that provides personalized content suggestions using collaborative filtering. Users upload a CSV file with user IDs, item IDs, and ratings, and the system creates recommendations by identifying similar users through cosine similarity calculations. The app features a user-friendly interface with customizable settings and basic visualizations of user preferences. Built with Python using Streamlit, Pandas, and scikit-learn, it can be launched by running `streamlit run app.py` after installing the required dependencies.
